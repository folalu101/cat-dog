# DOM Manipulation Practice

### Adding some interactivity to your web pages:

* Write a code selecting certain HTML elements and changing the background color to green.
* Now removing those elements.
*  A "cat vs dog" page - if you click a button for the cat to meow, the dog should bark back, and vice versa. 
* In addition to .prepend() and .append(), you can add content before or after the selected tags (rather than within them) with .before() and .after().
* A page where if a user clicks on an element some sort of image gets inserted into the page before or after that element. Also it allow the new image to be removed by a click as well.
